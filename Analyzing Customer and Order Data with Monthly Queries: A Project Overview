--This is a project with queries that retrieve some questions about orders and customers in tables with monthly orders.

--1. How many orders were placed in January?  

select count(*) from JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
and orderID IS NOT NULL
and orderID <> '';

--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
select count(*) from JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
and orderID IS NOT NULL
and orderID <> ''
and Product = 'iPhone';

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

select product, min(price) from JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
and orderID IS NOT NULL
and orderID <> '';

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

select product, sum(price) from JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
and orderID IS NOT NULL
and orderID <> ''
group by product
order by price;

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, 
--how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select 
sum(Quantity),

FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, 
--and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

select 
count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
